# Moire Patters on Java Script (canvas)

In mathematics, physics, and art, a moiré pattern (/mwɑːrˈeɪ/; French: [mwaˈʁe]) is a secondary and visually evident superimposed pattern created, for example, when two identical (usually transparent) patterns on a flat or curved surface (such as closely spaced straight lines drawn radiating from a point or taking the form of a grid) are overlaid while displaced or rotated a small amount from one another.

In physics, its manifestation is the beat phenomenon, that occurs in many wave interference conditions.

# Examples: 
- Lines: A moire pattern, formed by two sets of parallel lines, one set inclined at an angle of 5° to the other.
